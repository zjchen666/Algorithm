* 382 Linked List Random Node 

### 382 Linked List Random Node 
    Given a singly linked list, return a random node's value from the linked list. Each node must have the same probability of being chosen.
__Algorithm__
* __brutal force__ :
1. Get the length of link list.
2. Random pick one. 
3. Return the value of it.

### Reservoir sampling ### :
1. initial a k size result
2. go through the list one by one. 
3. check if random() <= k/k+m, if it is true, random pick up one result and replace it with the new element.

* select 1 element form a list with size n.  
n = 1 element probability 1* (1/1)  
n = 2 elements probability 1* (1/1) * (1- 1/2) = 1/2  
n = 3 elements probability 1* (1/2) * (1-1/3)  = 1/3  
n = k elements probabliity (1/k-1) * (1-1/k) = 1/k

* select k elements form a list. each nodes have the same probability.  
probability = k/(k + m), (0 < m < n)  
Probability of a element which is selected  
k/(k+m-1) * ((1 - k/(k+m)) + (k/(k+m) * (k-1)/k))  
= k/(k+m-1) * ((m/(k+m)) + k-1/(k+m))  
= k/(k+m-1) * (k+m-1)/(k+m)  
= k/(k+m)
